☐ Add admin and modded block tests so it's categories differently (command blocks, etc.)
☐ Add upload for components, image and templates (needs an API endpoint and/or git repo)
☐ Add template system that auto fills with the correct data (Needs testing)
☐ Add standard check (redstone don't affect other blocks) => warning if any redstone affects outside
☐ Make the translation system work
☐ Add good texture import for irregular models
☐ Add the replace system (all lights to air for example)
✘ Replace the blocks under ports by the port color (idk if we should do this) @cancelled(25-08-16 12:58)
