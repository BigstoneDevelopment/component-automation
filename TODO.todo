☐ Add admin block tests (command blocks, etc.)
☐ Add upload
☐ Add template system (Needs testing)
☐ Add standard check (redstone don't affect other blocks) => warning if not following the template
☐ Make the translation system work
☐ Add good texture import for irregular models
☐ Add the replace system (all lights to air for example)
☐ Replace the blocks under ports by the port color (idk if we should do this)
